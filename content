Inheritance:
The process of acquiring properties from one class(parent) to another class(child) is called inheritance.
It is mainly used for code re usability.
To implement multiple inheritance we use interfaces. We need to use implemets key word along with interfaces
Super key word is used to provide inheritance.

Encapsulation :
The process of wrapping up of variables and methods into single unit is called encapsulation.
Mainly it is used for hiding the data from out  side of the world.
This is achieved by getters and setters.


Interface:
Interface is a blue print of class. 
The interface tells what to do but not how to do.
Class is a implementor for interface.
Undefined or un implemented methods are called abstract methods.

Abstract classes:
Abstract classes are the classes which contain abstract methods.
We can use only extends key word for abstract class.

Abstraction:
 The process of hiding the implementation details and providing only functionality to the user is called abstraction.
